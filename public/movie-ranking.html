<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Amrithadhare</h3>
<p>I absolutely love Amrithadhare because it beautifully captures the essence 
   of love and relationships in a way that feels both real and relatable. 
   The characters of Puru and Amrutha, portrayed by Dhyan and Ramya, reflect 
   the struggles and joys of marriage, which makes their story incredibly engaging. 
   Their chemistry brings warmth to the screen, making you feel deeply connected 
   to their journey.</p>
<h3>Kranthi Veera Sangolli Rayanna</h3>
<p>I really enjoy Kranthi Veera Sangolli Rayanna because it powerfully portrays 
   the courage and determination of a freedom fighter who stood against oppression.
   Darshanâ€™s performance as Rayanna is incredibly inspiring; he embodies the spirit 
   of resistance and patriotism, making you root for his character throughout the 
   film. The way the story is told, with its rich visuals and intense action 
   sequences, keeps you engaged and emotionally invested in the fate of the 
   characters.</p>
<h3>The Kerala Story</h3>
<p>I really appreciate Kerala Story for its bold storytelling and the way it 
   sheds light on sensitive issues like manipulation and the complexities of faith.
   Adah Sharma's portrayal of Shalini is powerful and moving, capturing the 
   emotional turmoil of her character. The film doesn't shy away from difficult 
   subjects, which makes it a thought-provoking watch. It challenges viewers to 
   confront uncomfortable truths about society, leaving a lasting impression and 
   sparking important conversations.</p>
